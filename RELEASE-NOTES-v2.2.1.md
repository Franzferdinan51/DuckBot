# 🔥 DuckBot v2.2.1 - Critical Hotfix Release

## 🚨 **Critical Bug Fixes**

This hotfix addresses critical issues discovered in v2.2.0 that were causing systematic command failures.

### 🐛 **What Was Broken:**
- `/ask` commands failing in a pattern (every other command)
- Queue processing getting stuck after exceptions
- LM Studio health checks timing out too aggressively
- Race conditions in concurrent queue operations

### ✅ **What's Fixed:**

#### **1. Systematic Ask Command Failures**
- **Problem:** Every other `/ask` command would fail due to queue processing issues
- **Solution:** Fixed race conditions and improved error handling in queue processors

#### **2. Queue Processing Race Conditions**
- **Problem:** `currently_processing` flags getting stuck, preventing new commands
- **Solution:** Added thread-safe exception handling with `try/finally` blocks and proper locking

#### **3. Aggressive Health Check Timeouts**
- **Problem:** LM Studio health checks timing out after only 3 seconds
- **Solution:** Increased timeout to 10 seconds for more reliable connections

#### **4. Missing Core Functions**
- **Problem:** Missing `process_image_generation` and `process_server_queue` functions from backup restoration
- **Solution:** Restored all missing functions and fixed queue routing

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### **Queue Processing Reliability**
All queue processors now use proper exception handling:
```python
# Before: Flag could get stuck
server_queue['currently_processing'] = False

# After: Guaranteed cleanup
finally:
    async with server_queue['lock']:
        server_queue['currently_processing'] = False
```

### **Health Check Improvements**
- Increased LM Studio health check timeout from 3s to 10s
- Better error logging for debugging connection issues
- More graceful fallback when LM Studio is unavailable

## 📊 **Impact**

| Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Every other `/ask` failing | ✅ Fixed | High |
| Queue processing stuck | ✅ Fixed | High |
| Health check timeouts | ✅ Fixed | Medium |
| Missing core functions | ✅ Fixed | High |

## 🎯 **Who Should Update**

**🔴 CRITICAL:** If you're experiencing:
- `/ask` commands failing intermittently
- Commands getting "stuck" in queue
- "Unknown Integration" errors
- Systematic command failures

**📥 Update immediately to v2.2.1**

## 🔄 **Update Instructions**

1. **Stop** your current bot
2. **Backup** your current `DuckBot-v2.2-MULTI-SERVER.py`
3. **Replace** with the new v2.2.1 file
4. **Restart** the bot
5. **Test** `/ask` command multiple times to verify the fix

## ✅ **Verification**

After updating, verify the fix by:
1. Running `/ask test` multiple times in succession
